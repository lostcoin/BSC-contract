# BSC-contract

Lost Coin:

Through continuous wear and tear and continuous consumption in transactions, the currency will increase it's value

There are currently two wear methods available, and the team can set the parameter:

1.Linear wear: According to the percentage of the transaction volume, generally around 0.01% ~ 1%

2.Large amount of wear and tear: The larger the transaction amount, the greater the wear and tear. The maximum wear amount of a single transaction is 20%. For example, if you transfer 100 million, there will be 20% wear and tear.

We can precisely control the transfer loss, and can effectively overcome the effect of the big player. The wear and tear of the small player is smaller, allowing more people to participate.

The owner of this contract can then be transferred to a multi-signature wallet, so organization can control the wear factor together.

Lost coin has been deployed on Binance Smart Chain and add 90% of total amount liquidity has been added into [PancakeSwap](https://exchange.pancakeswap.finance/),

Lost 磨损币：

目前提供两种磨损方式，团队可以进行设置：

1.线性磨损 ：按交易额的百分比，一般在万分之一左右

2.大额磨损：交易额越大，磨损越大，单笔交易最高为20%，例如：转账1个亿，会有20%的磨损。
